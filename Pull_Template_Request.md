# Pull Request Template

## Description

This pull request implements an automated workflow for provisioning an AWS S3 bucket using Terraform and integrates cost analysis using the AWS Cost Explorer API. It includes a Python script (`terraform_finops_1.py`) that orchestrates the Terraform commands and retrieves cost data. Additionally, it provides a `README.md` with detailed instructions for setup and usage.

## Changes Made

* Created `main.tf` to define the AWS S3 bucket resource.
* Added `terraform.tfvars` for Terraform variable definitions.
* Developed `terraform_finops_1.py` to automate Terraform commands and retrieve cost data.
* Created `README.md` with setup instructions, usage examples, and troubleshooting tips.
* Removed the `random_string` terraform resource, and instead generate the bucket name within the python script.
* Modified the `analyze_terraform_cost` function to use the `SERVICE` dimension for cost analysis.
* Added inline comments to the python script.

## Testing

* Tested the Python script to ensure it correctly executes Terraform commands.
* Verified that the S3 bucket is created successfully.
* Confirmed that the cost data is retrieved and displayed correctly.
* Tested the script with different AWS profiles and regions.
* Tested the script after adding data to the s3 bucket, to ensure that the cost analysis reflects the addition of data.
