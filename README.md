# Claims Data Analysis Report

This Python script, `revenue_mgmt.py`, is designed to analyze claims data from a CSV file (`claims_data.csv`) and generate a comprehensive PDF report. The report includes an overview of the data, key metrics, a table of high-billed claims, and a trend analysis graph showing the number of claims over the last year.

## Features

* **Data Loading:** Reads claims data from a CSV file.
* **Data Overview:** Displays the first 10 rows of the dataset in a table within the PDF.
* **Key Metrics Calculation:** Calculates and presents key performance indicators (KPIs) such as average payment rate by provider, total billed and paid amounts per provider, and average patient age by claim type.
* **High-Billed Claims Identification:** Identifies and lists the top 5 claims with billed amounts exceeding a defined threshold.
* **Trend Analysis:** Generates a monthly trend graph showing the number of claims over the past year.
* **PDF Report Generation:** Creates a well-formatted PDF report (`claims_analysis.pdf`) using the ReportLab library.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the following installed:

* **Python:** Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
* **pandas:** A powerful data analysis library for Python (`pip install pandas`).
* **matplotlib:** A plotting library for Python (`pip install matplotlib`).
* **ReportLab:** A library for creating PDF documents in Python (`pip install reportlab`).

You will also need a CSV file named `claims_data.csv` in the same directory as the Python script. This file should contain your claims data with relevant columns (e.g., `Claim_Date`, `Billed_Amount`, `Paid_Amount`, `Insurance_Provider`, `Claim_Type`, `Patient_Age`).

## How to Use

1.  **Save the Script:** Save the provided Python code as `revenue_mgmt.py` in a directory of your choice.
2.  **Prepare Data:** Ensure you have a CSV file named `claims_data.csv` in the same directory as the script, containing your claims data. Make sure the column headers in your CSV file match the expectations of the script (though the script is designed to be somewhat robust).
3.  **Run the Script:** Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved `revenue_mgmt.py` and `claims_data.csv`, and run the script using the Python interpreter:

    ```bash
    python revenue_mgmt.py
    ```

4.  **View the Report:** Once the script finishes running, a PDF file named `claims_analysis.pdf` will be generated in the same directory. You can open this file with any PDF reader to view the claims data analysis report.

## Configuration

You can customize some parameters within the script:

* `pdf_filename`: The name of the output PDF file (default: `'claims_analysis.pdf'`).
* `high_bill_threshold`: The minimum billed amount to consider a claim as "high" (default: `4000`).
* `trend_analysis_duration`: The number of days for the trend analysis (default: `365` days, or one year).

You can modify these values directly in the script's configuration section at the beginning of the file.

## File Structure

The project consists of the following files:

* `revenue_mgmt.py`: The Python script for analyzing claims data and generating the report.
* `claims_data.csv`: (Expected) The CSV file containing the claims data.
* `claims_analysis.pdf`: (Generated) The PDF report containing the analysis.
* `claims_over_time_1year.png`: (Generated) The image file of the claims trend graph.

## Troubleshooting

* **`claims_data.csv` Not Found:** Ensure that the `claims_data.csv` file is in the same directory as the `revenue_mgmt.py` script.
* **Missing Libraries:** If you encounter `ModuleNotFoundError`, make sure you have installed the required libraries using `pip install` as mentioned in the Prerequisites section.
* **Incorrect Data Format:** If the script throws errors during data processing, check the format and column names in your `claims_data.csv` file.
* **PDF Not Generated:** Verify that the script runs without any errors in the terminal output. Check file permissions in the directory where the script is located.

## Further Enhancements

* Implement more sophisticated data visualizations.
* Add more detailed analysis and metrics.
* Allow for user-defined date ranges for analysis.
* Improve error handling and reporting.
